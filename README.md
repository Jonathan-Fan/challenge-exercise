#### Overview
  * Two folders are included, one for backend and the other one for frontend.
  * Please make sure backend is up and running before starting the frontend.
  * Please follow the `README.md` file in each folder to start the services.
  * Backend is implemented via serverless lambda function, using serverless offline to simulate RESTFul APIs.
  * Frontend is implemented by React, still a lots to do, such as CRUD participant, some css work to make it fancy, etc.
